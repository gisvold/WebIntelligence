\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This is a report for the group project in the course TDT4215 Web-intelligence spring 2013. In this assignment we are told to be a small consultancy providing web search \& intelligence applications. A Norwegian publisher of an electronic handbook for pharmaceutical interventions(Legemiddelh√•ndboka) has come to for help. They want us to improve their current keywords-based search interface and develop a search system that uses the patient record notes for the current patient and uses it as a search query to the various chapters of the handbook.
